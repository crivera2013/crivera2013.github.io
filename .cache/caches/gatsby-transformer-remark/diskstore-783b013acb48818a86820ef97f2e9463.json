Inserting experience replay between the actions of an agent does appear to minimize  correlation impact of consecutive actions on an agent’s neural network weights.  At the same time, increasing replay step frequency, unlike increasing batch size, does not minimize learning volatility.  The faster learner had a replay step frequency of one but also had the highest learning volatility with sharp upticks in knowledge gains (episodes 800-900 above) but also bouts of flat or negative knowledge gains (episodes 1000-1250).\nWe can further observe the lack of impact that changing the frequency replay steps has on an agent’s volatility in an environment by observing the test results for the different replay step agents.  While the agent with a replay step frequency of 1 is the least volatile, it does not have appreciably better performance in the testing phase.  This suggests that, while having a tight frequency of replay steps is preferable, it is less important of a hyperparameter than experience replay batch size when tuning a DQN RL agent.","position":{"start":{"line":34,"column":1,"offset":5536},"end":{"line":35,"column":528,"offset":6816},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":34,"column":1,"offset":5536},"end":{"line":35,"column":528,"offset":6816},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"children":[{"type":"link","url":"#why-experience-replay-makes-sense-in-the-context-of-the-lunar-lander","title":null,"children":[],"data":{"hProperties":{"aria-label":"why experience replay makes sense in the context of the lunar lander permalink","class":"anchor before"},"hChildren":[{"type":"raw","value":"<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg>"}]}},{"type":"text","value":"Why experience replay makes sense in the context of the Lunar Lander","position":{"start":{"line":37,"column":4,"offset":6823},"end":{"line":37,"column":72,"offset":6891},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":37,"column":1,"offset":6820},"end":{"line":37,"column":72,"offset":6891},"indent":[]},"data":{"id":"why-experience-replay-makes-sense-in-the-context-of-the-lunar-lander","htmlAttributes":{"id":"why-experience-replay-makes-sense-in-the-context-of-the-lunar-lander"},"hProperties":{"id":"why-experience-replay-makes-sense-in-the-context-of-the-lunar-lander","style":"position:relative;"}}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"As the results so far have shown, with both high frequency replay steps and large batch sizes, experience replay-enhanced RL agents perform better in the Lunar Lander scenario.  As mentioned previously, experience replay prevents overfitting caused by the correlation effect of consecutive steps in.  In the Lunar Lander scenario, this overfitting manifests itself in poor results due to the fact that the “landing zone” is located in the middle of the screen and because the agent does not receive any information regarding acceleration.  The agent is only given information regarding velocity and position which leads to over-correction caused by greedy immediate knowledge.  For example, If the agent starship position was located on the far left corner of the screen, the agent would be rewarded for activating the left booster thus pushing it closer to center and landing zone.  The agent would repeatedly activate the left booster to get more reward but, at a certain point, would have so much acceleration that the otherwise small left booster activation would launch the agent to the far right corner, missing the center, and receiving a large negative reward.  An agent with experience replay would hold a diminished value for repeatedly activating the left booster and would then not overshoot the landing zone.","position":{"start":{"line":38,"column":1,"offset":6893},"end":{"line":38,"column":1322,"offset":8214},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":38,"column":1,"offset":6893},"end":{"line":38,"column":1322,"offset":8214},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"children":[{"type":"link","url":"#experiment-3-changing-the-learning-rate-for-iterative-update","title":null,"children":[],"data":{"hProperties":{"aria-label":"experiment 3 changing the learning rate for iterative update permalink","class":"anchor before"},"hChildren":[{"type":"raw","value":"<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg>"}]}},{"type":"text","value":"Experiment 3: Changing the learning rate for iterative update","position":{"start":{"line":40,"column":4,"offset":8221},"end":{"line":40,"column":65,"offset":8282},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":40,"column":1,"offset":8218},"end":{"line":40,"column":65,"offset":8282},"indent":[]},"data":{"id":"experiment-3-changing-the-learning-rate-for-iterative-update","htmlAttributes":{"id":"experiment-3-changing-the-learning-rate-for-iterative-update"},"hProperties":{"id":"experiment-3-changing-the-learning-rate-for-iterative-update","style":"position:relative;"}}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"image","title":null,"url":"/media/learningRateTrain.png","alt":"alt text","position":{"start":{"line":42,"column":1,"offset":8286},"end":{"line":42,"column":42,"offset":8327},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":42,"column":1,"offset":8286},"end":{"line":42,"column":42,"offset":8327},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"image","title":null,"url":"/media/learningRateTest.png","alt":"alt text","position":{"start":{"line":44,"column":1,"offset":8331},"end":{"line":44,"column":41,"offset":8371},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":44,"column":1,"offset":8331},"end":{"line":44,"column":41,"offset":8371},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"A component of a neural network model is the optimization function it uses to update its weights during training.

In the 100 testing episodes, the RL agent achieved a negative score only twice and had a score of 200 or more 71% of the time.  With even more training, the model’s performance would improve even more but, at this point, these results show the effectiveness of DQN agents.","position":{"start":{"line":55,"column":1,"offset":10285},"end":{"line":55,"column":586,"offset":10870},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":55,"column":1,"offset":10285},"end":{"line":55,"column":586,"offset":10870},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"children":[{"type":"link","url":"#conclusion","title":null,"children":[],"data":{"hProperties":{"aria-label":"conclusion permalink","class":"anchor before"},"hChildren":[{"type":"raw","value":"<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg>"}]}},{"type":"text","value":"Conclusion","position":{"start":{"line":57,"column":4,"offset":10877},"end":{"line":57,"column":14,"offset":10887},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":57,"column":1,"offset":10874},"end":{"line":57,"column":14,"offset":10887},"indent":[]},"data":{"id":"conclusion","htmlAttributes":{"id":"conclusion"},"hProperties":{"id":"conclusion","style":"position:relative;"}}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"In this paper, we observed how artificial neural networks can be applied as Q-learning function approximators in order for reinforcement learning agents to solve non-trivial Partially-Observable Markov Decision Processes.
