A Philadelphia techie who can't believe he is making a blog.  Currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.  The day job is teaching Python and predictive analytic skills to investment management folks and developing software.  Also I probably watch way too much Simpsons, but that's a personal problem.
